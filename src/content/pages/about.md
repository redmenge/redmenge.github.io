## Germán Redondo - Cybersecurity Analyst

**Hello! ^^**  I'm Germán, a Networks and Cybersecurity professional residing in the picturesque landscapes of [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia). I started my journey when I first studied my Bachelors of Science in Electronics Engineering with a keen focus on networks and telecom principles, ever since then my path went onwards into discovering the wonders of the digital world and how we went from 0s and 1s to achieving high performance transferring processes machines that can do complex calculations in matter of a second's fraction.

## Skills and Expertise

I have a strong foundation on security principles such as the NIST Frameworks, fundamental knowledge on the TCP/IP and OSI model’s layers and how they play their roles in the Internet, dominion over programming languages such as Python, JS, HTML, CSS, C++ and ohers; managing and configuring network devices such as Firewalls, Server and Workstations. I have developed many tools at the start of my career to ensure a multidisciplinary approach in bringing the best solutions.
## Providing best effort solutions

I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering secure products that ensure all layers of defense are implemented in my work. To ensure firewall rules cover the entirety of a corporate network in keeping them safe, to propose practices that will make enterprises aware of the danger they face if they click on suspicious links or files, and the consequences it may bring.

## Global Perspective, Local Impact

Living and growing up in Colombia has helped me understand that no matter where we are, we are always at the stake of being attacked by unknown threats, whether it’s a physical or a digital threat we must always make sure to be prepared for this sort of threats and tackle it by using the best practices we have been developing.

## Continuous Learning

The dynamic nature of the tech industry inspires me to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements. I’m always eager to expand my skill set, embrace emerging technologies, and learn how to use them in a safe environment.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication. Whether working with clients, or fellow IT professionals, I value clear communication to ensure the success of every project.
